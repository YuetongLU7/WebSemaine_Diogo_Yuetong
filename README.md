## Overview
A free and simple currency converter web application that allows users to calculate exchange rates dynamically using real-time data. This static web application fetches exchange rates from the Frankfurter API and displays historical exchange trends in an interactive chart.

## Features
- üìå **Real-time exchange rates** using the [Frankfurter API](https://www.frankfurter.app/)
- üìä **Interactive exchange rate chart** powered by Chart.js
- üåç **Support for multiple currencies** with automatic country flag display
- üñ•Ô∏è **Fully responsive design** using Tailwind CSS

## Technologies Used
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (Frontend development)
- **Tailwind CSS** (Styling framework)
- **Chart.js** (Data visualization)
- **Frankfurter API** (Currency exchange rate provider)

## Installation & Usage
This project is a static webpage and does not require any installation. You can simply clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser.

### Clone Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/YuetongLU7/WebSemaine_Diogo_Yuetong.git
cd WebSemaine_Diogo_Yuetong
```

### Open Locally
Open `index.html` in your browser:
```sh
open index.html
```
Or if you are using a local server:
```sh
python -m http.server 8000  # Python 3
```
Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## API Integration
The exchange rates are fetched from the Frankfurter API. The API call format:
```js
fetch(`https://api.frankfurter.app/latest?base=USD&symbols=EUR,GBP,JPY`)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```

## Improvements

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ API Nesting: Efficient Data Fetching
We implemented **API nesting** to optimize data retrieval. First, we populate the currency selection dropdowns by fetching available currencies dynamically from the **Frankfurter API**. Once the dropdowns are updated, we then proceed to fetch exchange rate data, ensuring **smooth execution** and avoiding unnecessary API calls.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Dynamic Dropdown Update: Populating Currency Options Dynamically
Previously, available currencies were hardcoded, which limited flexibility. Now, the dropdown lists are populated dynamically from the **Frankfurter API**, ensuring that users always have access to the latest currency options.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Preventing Selection of the Same Currency
To **prevent users from selecting the same currency** as both the base and target currency, we dynamically update the dropdown options:
   - When the user selects a base currency, that currency is **removed** from the target currency dropdown.
   - When the user selects a target currency, that currency is **removed** from the base currency dropdown.
   - If both are the same, the system **automatically selects an alternative valid currency**.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Fetching Exchange Rates: `fetchExchangeRate()`
This function retrieves exchange rate data for the selected currency pair by requesting data from the **Frankfurter API**. The function processes the returned JSON data and extracts relevant exchange rates for calculations.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Real-Time Rate Display: `updateTextSnippet()`
This function ensures real-time updates to the displayed exchange rate, showing **the exact timestamp** and the **exchange rate for 1 unit** of the base currency. This helps users track the most recent exchange rate.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Historical Exchange Rate Chart: `updateChartWithRate()`
The chart visualizes exchange rate fluctuations over the past **30 days**:
   - The **x-axis** represents **dates** (timeline of exchange rate changes).
   - The **y-axis** represents **exchange rates** (currency values over time).
   - The chart is dynamically updated each time the user selects a new currency pair.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Clean Code & Best Practices
We follow **Uncle Bob's Clean Code Principles**, ensuring:
   - **Single-responsibility functions** (each function has a distinct, well-defined purpose).
   - **Modular design** (functions are independent and reusable).
   - **Maintainability** (code is structured, clear, and scalable).
   - **Python environment management** using `uv`.
