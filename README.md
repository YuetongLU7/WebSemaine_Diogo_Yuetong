## Overview
A free and simple currency converter web application that allows users to calculate exchange rates dynamically using real-time data. This static web application fetches exchange rates from the Frankfurter API and displays historical exchange trends in an interactive chart.

## Features
- üìå **Real-time exchange rates** using the [Frankfurter API](https://www.frankfurter.app/)
- üìä **Interactive exchange rate chart** powered by Chart.js
- üåç **Support for multiple currencies** with automatic country flag display
- üñ•Ô∏è **Fully responsive design** using Tailwind CSS

## Technologies Used
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (Frontend development)
- **Tailwind CSS** (Styling framework)
- **Chart.js** (Data visualization)
- **Frankfurter API** (Currency exchange rate provider)

## Installation & Usage
This project is a static webpage and does not require any installation. You can simply clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser.

### Clone Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/YuetongLU7/WebSemaine_Diogo_Yuetong.git
cd WebSemaine_Diogo_Yuetong
```

### Open Locally
Open `index.html` in your browser:
```sh
open index.html
```
Or if you are using a local server:
```sh
python -m http.server 8000  # Python 3
```
Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## API Integration
The exchange rates are fetched from the Frankfurter API. The API call format:
```js
fetch(`https://api.frankfurter.app/latest?base=USD&symbols=EUR,GBP,JPY`)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```

## Improvements

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ API Nesting: Efficient Data Fetching
We implemented **API nesting** to optimize data retrieval. The process ensures that the **currency selection dropdowns are updated first**, and only after this step does the system request the latest exchange rate. This prevents unnecessary API calls and ensures smoother execution.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Dynamic Dropdown Update: Populating Currency Options Dynamically
Instead of hardcoding available currencies, we now retrieve them dynamically from the **Frankfurter API**. This ensures that our dropdown lists always reflect the most up-to-date selection of supported currencies.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Preventing Selection of the Same Currency
We implemented logic to prevent users from selecting **the same currency** as both the base and target. If a user selects the same currency in both fields, the system **automatically selects an alternative valid option** to maintain correctness.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Fetching Exchange Rates: `fetchExchangeRate()`
This function retrieves exchange rate data for the selected currency pair and stores the most recent exchange rate for conversion.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Real-Time Rate Display: `updateTextSnippet()`
This function updates the displayed exchange rate in real-time, showing the **current timestamp** and the **exchange rate for 1 unit** of the base currency.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Historical Exchange Rate Chart: `updateChartWithRate()`
The chart visualizes exchange rate fluctuations over the past **30 days**, providing valuable market insights. The **x-axis** represents the **dates**, and the **y-axis** represents the exchange rate.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Clean Code & Best Practices
We follow **Uncle Bob's Clean Code Principles**, emphasizing **single-responsibility functions** and modular, maintainable code. We also use **uv** for Python environment management.
